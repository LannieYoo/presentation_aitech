# CST8504 Presentation 2: ROS 2 and Vision Capabilities

## Group Formation

Form a group of 3 or 4 members, and have one person from the group submit the names to Brightspace under this assignment by the Brightspace due date (which is for group formation). After presenting, each member will additionally submit their peer review spreadsheet, and one member of each group will submit the presentation materials (slide deck, video, other documents).

## Peer Review Spreadsheet

After the group formation due date, a spreadsheet for peer reviewing will be posted to Brightspace, already populated with group name lists.

## Overview

ROS 2 is a prominent platform for robotics projects. We have been studying how to use ROS 2 and MediaPipe to give the Create 3 vision capabilities. Using your experience so far, you will work with a team of students to create an educational presentation to help yourselves and other students ramp up on topics such as ROS 2, CNNs, and MediaPipe.

## Activity

Working in groups of 3-4 members, create an educational presentation (7 to 12 minutes long) on the subject of ROS 2 and implementing publishers and subscribers to give the Create 3 robot vision capabilities. Video format or live presentation format are both acceptable. In lab class, we will view the presentations as a group, and each student will participate in the grading by assigning a score to each presentation including your own. Furthermore, you will also assign a score to each member of your own group.

## Content Guidelines

The presentation or video should be based the actual experience of the team members, and dedicated to using that experience to help a future student work with ROS 2, implementing publishers and subscribers, and MediaPipe. While adhering to the 7-12 minute time boundaries, you are free to design your presentation to give a broad overview of helpful information, or alternatively, your team can concentrate on a smaller number of topics that you feel are most important to address to ensure learning success for students.

Example appropriate topics (not limited to these):

What is ROS 2

Publish/Subscribe

Client/Server

Architecture of the AISD ROS 2 packages

CNNs in Machine Vision

Convolutions

Pooling

MediaPipe

How to use MediaPipe in Python modules

MediaPipe Hands module

Create 3 and Linux

Development using Ubuntu-server without GUI

Putty and SSH keys

Git, GitHub, SSH keys

Advice for classmates learning ROS 2, CNNs, and MediaPipe

Tips and Tricks for success

Potential pitfalls to avoid while learning ROS 2

## Methodology

It is important to decide early on strategy and an outline of what the content of your presentation will be. Begin by meeting as a group to take inventory of each group member's experiences and thoughts on working with ROS 2, Python, and Linux. Design the content of your presentation to be representative of your group. Try to take advantage of your student's-eye-view. The possibilities are open, but here are some examples strategies your group might choose for a basis of your presentation:

If one or more members of your group is struggling with ROS 2, Python, Linux, etc, and one or more members of your group feels quite confident, then that is a golden opportunity to make your presentation about how the group members worked with each other on overcoming some of the struggles. The confident members can bring to the table advice, studying strategies, tutoring attempts, etc, and the struggling members can bring to the table verification of what seems to work well, and what doesn't seem to work as well, and why.

If all of your group members are confident and the robotics development is going well for everyone, then that is a golden opportunity to pick one or two of the really difficult topics relating to the robotics development we’ve been doing, and explain it in more detail than you have so far. Why is it difficult? Why is it important? How can an understanding of the topic make you a better AI software developer?

If all of your group members are struggling with robotics and/or linux, then that is a golden opportunity to make a presentation about the details of the struggles that students might face when trying to learn how to do this kind of development. Compare notes with your team-mates on what are the most troublesome concepts, and why they are troubling compared to what you are used to.

## Delivery of Presentation

Each group member must do some speaking in the video or during the live presentation, depending on which of those two formats you have chosen. While you are speaking (or being recorded for video) you are representing, from your own point of view, your contribution to the tutorial and advice your team is providing to future students.

We will watch all the presentations together in a dedicated Lab or Lecture Period, and each student will assign a peer-review grade to each group including their own, as well as a peer-review grade to each member of their own group (including themselves).

## Grading

Your grade for the presentation will be calculated as a combination of the average peer-assigned grade, with potential adjustments by the professor.
